# Payments site
A payments site like Zelle, paypal, venmo ect. Users will be able to sign up and send payments to other users who have done so. A public feed of who has sent a payment will be visible to users. For the front end and back end, we used Java, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, for the database MongoDB, and for the API platform, we used Postman.

# What I Learned

* Implemented functinality to the UI: 
  * display a feed of public transactions,
  * Create a signup form to create a username/password combo
  * Only allow payments to valid users
* Collection to store transactions/payments
